# WHAT DOES THIS TOOL DO?
#
# In order for MAA ZH-server features to be compatible with global servers,
# crops/screenshots/templates of ZH servers with Chinese characters etc. must be
# replaced with those of corresponding global servers, which needs your help.
# This tool helps you find which templates in ZH server (usually recently added)
# have not yet had a global server version, and copy them to a separate folder
# so that you can easily .
#
# There are some ZH templates without any Chinese characters etc. which can thus
# be used across different servers. You may add them to the ignore_list.txt
# file.
#
# USAGE
#
# 1. Install Python
# 2. Run "$python diff_resource.py xxx" in the terminal where xxx is the desired
# server name i.e. YoStarJP/YoStarEN/YoStarKR/txwy
# 3. Results can be found in the missing_templates folder
#
