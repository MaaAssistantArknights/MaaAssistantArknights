The build artifacts are runnable MAA instances.</p><p>In addition to the necessary MaaCore, Windows build artifacts include MaaWpfGui, macOS build artifacts include MaaMacGui, and Linux build artifacts include MaaCLI.</p><p>This workflow runs automatically on any new commit and PR. When triggered by a release PR, the build artifacts from this run will be used directly for release and will create a Release.</p><h3 id="code-security-scanning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#code-security-scanning"><span>Code Security Scanning</span></a></h3><p>Code security scanning uses CodeQL to analyze code and workflows for security vulnerabilities, with the following workflows:</p><p><code>codeql-core.yml</code></p><p>This workflow performs security analysis on the C++ and C# code of MaaCore and MaaWpfGui, detecting potential security vulnerabilities.</p><p>It runs automatically on PRs that modify relevant source code, and also executes daily scheduled checks at 11:45 UTC.</p><p><code>codeql-wf.yml</code></p><p>This workflow performs security analysis on GitHub Actions workflow files themselves, ensuring the security of the CI/CD processes.</p><p>It runs automatically on PRs that modify workflow files, and also executes daily scheduled checks at 12:00 UTC.</p><h3 id="version-release" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#version-release"><span>Version Release</span></a></h3><p>Version release is the necessary operation to publish updates to users, consisting of the following workflows:</p><ul><li><code>release-nightly-ota.yml</code> Release nightly builds</li><li><code>release-ota.yml</code> Release stable/beta versions <ul><li><code>release-preparation.yml</code> Generate changelog and prepare release for stable/beta versions</li><li><code>pr-auto-tag.yml</code> Generate tags for stable/beta versions</li></ul></li></ul><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>The &quot;ota&quot; in the above file names stands for Over-the-Air, which is what we commonly call &quot;incremental update packages&quot;.
