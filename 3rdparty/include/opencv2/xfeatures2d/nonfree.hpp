/** @brief Class for extracting Speeded Up Robust Features from an image @cite Bay06 .

The algorithm parameters:
-   member int extended
    -   0 means that the basic descriptors (64 elements each) shall be computed
    -   1 means that the extended descriptors (128 elements each) shall be computed
-   member int upright
    -   0 means that detector computes orientation of each feature.
    -   1 means that the orientation is not computed (which is much, much faster). For example,
if you match images from a stereo pair, or do image stitching, the matched features
likely have very similar angles, and you can speed up feature extraction by setting
upright=1.
-   member double hessianThreshold
Threshold for the keypoint detector. Only features, whose hessian is larger than
hessianThreshold are retained by the detector. Therefore, the larger the value, the less
keypoints you will get. A good default value could be from 300 to 500, depending from the
image contrast.
-   member int nOctaves
The number of a gaussian pyramid octaves that the detector uses. It is set to 4 by default.
If you want to get very large features, use the larger value. If you want just small
features, decrease it.
-   member int nOctaveLayers
The number of images within each octave of a gaussian pyramid. It is set to 2 by default.
@note
   -   An example using the SURF feature detector can be found at
        opencv_source_code/samples/cpp/generic_descriptor_match.cpp
    -   Another example using the SURF feature detector, extractor and matcher can be found at
        opencv_source_code/samples/cpp/matcher_simple.cpp
