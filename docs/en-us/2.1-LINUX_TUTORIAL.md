# Linux Compilation Tutorial

**The tutorial requires some basic knowledge about Linux OS!**

> **Note**
> Linux build of MAA is still under discussion, some of the content might be outdated, please follow the script in [GitHub workflow file](../.github/workflows/release-maa-linux.yml)

## Compiling MAA

1. Download build depends

    - Ubuntu/Debian

    ```bash
    sudo apt install gcc-12 g++-12 cmake zlib1g-dev
    ```

    - Arch Linux

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S --needed gcc cmake zlib
    ```

2. Build or download third-party libraries

    - Donwload pre-built libraries (recommended)

        > **Note**
        > It contains shared objects built on a relatively new linux distro (Ubuntu 22.04), which may cause ABI incompatibility if you are working on a system with older version of libstdc++.
        ```cmd
        python maadeps-download.py
        ```

    - Build from source

        ```cmd
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        python maadeps-build.py
        ```

3. Build MAA

    ```bash
    mkdir -p build
    CC=gcc-12 CXX=g++-12 cmake -B build \
        -DINSTALL_THIRD_LIBS=ON \
        -DINSTALL_RESOURCE=ON \
        -DINSTALL_PYTHON=ON
    cmake --build build
    ```

    To install MAA to the target location, note that MAA is recommended to run by specifying `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, do not use administrator privileges to load MAA into `/`

    ```bash
    cmake --install build --prefix <target_directory>
    ```
