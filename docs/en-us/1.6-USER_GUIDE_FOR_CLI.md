### Build from source

You can also build from source by yourself with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/maa-cli.git --bin maa --locked
```

### Dependencies

#### MaaCore

`maa-cli` only provides a interface for MaaCore, it needs `MaaCore` and resources to run tasks, which can be installed by `maa install`:

```bash
maa install
```

## Usage

### Commands

The main feature of `maa-cli` is to run tasks, you can run a task by `maa run <task>`. Here `<task>` is the name of a task, you can list all available tasks by `maa list`.

More details can be found by `maa help`.

## Configurations

### Configuration directory

All configurations of `maa-cli` is located in a specific configuration directory, which can be get by `maa dir config`.
The configuration directory can be changed by environment variable `MAA_CONFIG_DIR`. In below examples, we will use `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR` to represent the configuration directory.

All configuration files can be written in TOML, YAML or JSON format. In below examples, we will use TOML format and `.toml` as file extension. But you can mix these three formats as long as the file extension is correct.

### Define tasks

A `maa-cli` task should be defined in a single file, which should be located in `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR/tasks` directory.

#### Basic structure

A `maa-cli` task is a sequence of `MAA` tasks, each `MAA` task is defined by `type` and `params` fields:

```toml
[[tasks]]
type = "StartUp" # the type of maa task
params = { client_type = "Official", start_game_enabled = true } # the params of given task
```

See documentation of [MAA](https://maa.plus/docs/en-us/3.1-INTEGRATION.html#asstappendtask) for all available task types and params.

#### Task variants and conditions

In some case, you may want to run a task with different params in different conditions. You can define multiple variants for a task, and use `condition` field to determine whether the variant should be used. For example, you may want to use different infrast plan in different time period of a day:

```toml
[[tasks]]
type = "Infrast"

[tasks.params]
mode = 10000
facility = ["Trade", "Reception", "Mfg", "Control", "Power", "Office", "Dorm"]
dorm_trust_enabled = true
filename = "normal.json" # the filename of custom infrast plan

# use plan 1 before 12:00:00, use plan 2 between 12:00:00 and 18:00:00, use plan 0 after 18:00:00
[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Time", end = "12:00:00" } # if start is not defined, it will be 00:00:00
params = { plan_index = 1 }

[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Time", start = "12:00:00", end = "18:00:00" }
params = { plan_index = 2 }

[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Time", start = "18:00:00" } # if end is not defined, it will be 23:59:59
params = { plan_index = 0 }
```

The `condition` field is used to determine whether the variant should be used,
and the `params` field of matched variant will be merged into the params of the task.

**Note**: If the `filename` field is a relative path, it will be relative to `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR/infrast`. Besides, the custom infrast plan file will not be read by `maa-cli` but `MaaCore`. So the format of the file must be `JSON` and time period defined in the file will not be used to select the corresponding sub-plan. So you must specify the `plan_index` field in the params of the task to use the correct infrast plan in the corresponding time period. This will ensure that the correct infrast plan is used in the appropriate time period.

Besides of `Time` condition, there are also `DateTime`, `Weakday`, and `Combined` conditions. `DateTime` condition is used to specify a specific datetime period, `Weekday` condition is used to specify some days in a week, `Combined` condition is used to specify a combination of multiple conditions.

```toml
[[tasks]]
type = "Fight"

# fight SL-8 on summer event
[[tasks.variants]]
params = { stage = "SL-8" }
condition = { type = "DateTime", start = "2023-08-01T16:00:00", end = "2023-08-21T03:59:59" }
# fight CE-6 on Tue, Thu, Sat if not on summer event
[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Weekday", weekdays = ["Tue", "Thu", "Sat"] }
params = { stage = "CE-6" }
# fight 1-7 otherwise
[[tasks.variants]]
params = { stage = "1-7" }
```

With default strategy, if multiple variants are matched, only the first one will be used. And if the condition is not given, the variant will always be matched. So you can put a variant without condition at the end of variants.

The strategy of matching variants can be changed by `strategy` field:

```toml
[[tasks]]
type = "Fight"
strategy = "merge" # or "first" (default)

# use all expiring medicine on Sunday night
[[tasks.variants]]
params = { expiring_medicine = 1000 }
[tasks.variants.condition]
type = "Combined"
conditions = [
  { type = "Time", start = "18:00:00" },
  { type = "Weekday", weekdays = ["Sun"] },
]

# fight 1-7 by default
[[tasks.variants]]
params = { stage = "1-7" }

# fight CE-6 on Tue, Thu, Sat if not on summer event
[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Weekday", weekdays = ["Tue", "Thu", "Sat"] }
params = { stage = "CE-6" }

# fight SL-8 on summer event
[[tasks.variants]]
params = { stage = "SL-8" }
condition = { type = "DateTime", start = "2023-08-01T16:00:00", end = "2023-08-21T03:59:59" }
```

The outcome stage of this example should be identical to the previous one, but expiring medicine will be used on Sunday night additionally.
With the `merge` strategy, if multiple variants are matched, the params of all matched variants will be merged. If multiple variants have the same param, the last one will be used.

If no variant is matched, the task will not be executed, which is useful when you want to only run a task in some conditions:

```toml
# Mall after 18:00
[[tasks]]
type = "Mall"

[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Time", start = "18:00:00" }
```

#### User input

In some case, you may want to input some value at runtime, instead of hard code it in the task file. Such as the stage to fight, the item to buy, etc. You can specify the value as `Input` or `Select` type:

```toml
[[tasks]]
type = "Fight"

# Select a stage to fight
[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "DateTime", start = "2023-08-01T16:00:00", end = "2023-08-21T03:59:59" }

# Set the stage to a `Select` type with alternatives and description
[tasks.variants.params.stage]
alternatives = ["SL-6", "SL-7", "SL-8"] # the alternatives of stage, at least one alternative should be given
description = "a stage to fight in summer event" # description of the input, optional

# Task without input
[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Weekday", weekdays = ["Tue", "Thu", "Sat"] }
params = { stage = "CE-6" }

# Input a stage to fight
[[tasks.variants]]

# Set the stage to a `Input` type with default value and description
[tasks.variants.params.stage]
default = "1-7" # default value of stage, optional (if not given, user can input empty value to re-prompt)
description = "a stage to fight" # description of the input, optional
```

For `Input` type, a prompt will be shown to ask user to input a value. If the default value is given, it will be used if user input empty value, otherwise it will re-prompt. For `Select` type, a prompt will be shown to ask user to select a value from alternatives (by index). If user input is not a valid index, it will re-prompt. The promote and input can be disabled by `--batch` option, which is useful for running tasks in Schedule.

### `MaaCore` related configurations

The related configurations of `MaaCore` is located in `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR/asst.toml`. The current available configurations are:

```toml
user_resource = true
resources = ["platform_diff/iOS"]

[connection]
type = "ADB"
adb_path = "adb"
device = "emulator-5554"
config = "CompatMac"

[static_options]
cpu_ocr = false
gpu_ocr = 1

[instance_options]
touch_mode = "MAATouch"
deployment_with_pause = false
adb_lite_enabled = false
kill_adb_on_exit = false
```

The feild `user_resource` is used to specify whether load user resource, which is a boolean value. If it is `true`, additional resources in `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR/resource` directory will be loaded at last (after all other resources). This is identical to the `--user-resource` command line option. See `maa help run` for more information.

The `resources` field is used to specify additional resources, which is a list of resource directories (if relative path is given, it will be relative to `$(maa dir resource)/resource` directory):

The `connection` section is used to specify how to connect to the game. Currently, there are two types of connection: `ADB` and `PlayTools`.

If you use `ADB`, you should set `adb_path` and `device` fields:

```toml
[connection]
type = "ADB"
adb_path = "adb" # the path of adb executable
device = "emulator-5554" # the serial of your android device
config = "General" # the config of maa
```

If you use `PlayTools`, you should set `address` which is the address of MaaTools set in PlayCover, more details can be found at
[here](https://maa.plus/docs/en-us/1.4-EMULATOR_SUPPORTS_FOR_MAC.html#✅-playcover-the-software-runs-most-fluently-for-its-nativity-🚀):

```toml
[connection]
type = "PlayTools"
address = "localhost:1717" # the address of MaaTools
config = "CompatMac" # the same as above
```

Both `ADB` and `PlayTools` share the `config` field, which is a parameter of `connect` function of maa.It's default value is `CompatMac` on macOS, `CompatPOSIXShell` on Linux and `General` on other platforms. More optional configs can be found in `config.json` in resource directory.

The `instance_options` section is used to configure maa [instance options](https://maa.plus/docs/en-us/3.1-INTEGRATION.html#asstsetinstanceoption):

```toml
[instance_options]
touch_mode = "ADB" # touch mode to use, can be "ADB", "MiniTouch", "MAATouch" or "MacPlayTools" (only for PlayCover)
deployment_with_pause = false # whether pause the game when deployment
adb_lite_enabled = false # whether use adb-lite
kill_adb_on_exit = false # whether kill adb when exit
```

Note: If you connect to the game with `PlayCover`, the `touch_mode` will be ignored and `MacPlayTools` will be used.

### `maa-cli` related configurations

The `maa-cli` related configurations should be located in `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR/cli.toml`. Currently, it only contains one section: `core`:

```toml
[core]
channel = "beta"
[core.components]
resource = false
```

The `channel` field is used to specify the channel of `MaaCore` to install, which can be `stable`, `beta` or `alpha`. The components of `MaaCore` to install can be specified by `components` field, which is a table of boolean values. Currently, only `resource` component is supported.
