## How to Use

### Basic Settings

Check [Beginner's Guide](./manual/newbie.md) and [User Manual](./manual/introduction/).
::: tip
For YostarEN, due to interface layout issues, the only supported resolution is `1920x1080`
:::

### Features

Please refer to the [User Manual](./manual/).

### Supports for overseas clients

At present, most of the functions of the International client (US client), Japanese client, Korean client, and traditional Chinese client have been supported. However, due to the small number of overseas users and the shortage of project personnel, many functions have not been fully tested, so please experience it yourself.  
If you encounter a bug or have a strong demand for a certain function, welcome to [Issues](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/discussions) to ask questions. And feel free to join us in building the MAA! Please refer to [Overseas Clients Adaptation](#overseas-clients-adaptation)

### CLI Support

MAA supports command line interface (CLI) operation, supports Linux, macOS and Windows, and can be used for automated scripts or on servers without graphical interfaces. Check [CLI Guide](./manual/cli/)

#### About DirectML.dll

- Source: Official Microsoft
- License: Please refer to Microsoft's DirectML terms of use
