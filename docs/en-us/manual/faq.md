# FAQs

If this is your first time using MAA, please read [Getting Started](./newbie.md).

::: warning

If MAA fails to run after an update, or if you've reached this page via an error window in MAA, it's highly likely due to outdated runtime libraries.  
The most frequent issue is runtime-related, yet many users ignore the documentation and ask around, so we replaced the pinned message with this. It's frustrating.

Please run `DependencySetup_依赖库安装.bat` in the MAA directory, or execute the commands below in a terminal,

```sh
winget install "Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64" --override "/repair /passive /norestart" --force --uninstall-previous --accept-package-agreements && winget install "Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.8" --override "/repair /passive /norestart" --force --uninstall-previous --accept-package-agreements
```

or manually download and install the following <u>**two**</u> runtime libraries to resolve the issue.

- [Visual C++ Redistributable x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- [.NET Desktop Runtime 8](https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/windowsdesktop-runtime-win-x64.exe)

## The program crashes immediately when I try to run it

### Incomplete file downloaded

- If you don't have a complete package of this software already, please DO NOT download the zip files marked with `OTA` in the file name, which are for incremental updates and shall not be used alone. In most cases, Windows users should download `MAA-vX.X.X-win-x64.zip`.
  In most cases, you need x64 operating system and x64 variant of MAA, i.e. `MAA-*-win-x64.zip`. There is no support for 32-bit (x86) operating systems.
- If you find that certain features are missing or not working after an automatic update, it may be due to an issue during the update process. Please re-download and extract the full installation package. After extraction, drag the `config` folder from the old `MAA` folder into the newly extracted `MAA` folder.

### Missing runtime libraries

Find the upward ↑ arrow at the bottom right corner of the webpage and click it.

### System Issues

- MAA does not support 32-bit operating systems and does not support Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1.
- The above runtime installations all require the Component Store Service (CBS, TrustedInstaller/TiWorker, WinSxS).
  If the Component Store Service is damaged, it cannot be installed properly.

We cannot provide repair suggestions other than reinstalling the system, so please avoid using "slimmed-down" systems that do not specify slimming items and slimming risks, or very old versions of systems.

#### Windows N/KN

For Windows N/KN (Europe/Korea), you also need to install the [Media Feature Pack](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/c1c6fffa-d052-8338-7a79-a4bb980a700a).

#### Notes on Windows 7

.NET 8 does not support Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 systems<sup>[source](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7556)</sup>, so MAA also no longer supports them. The last available .NET 8 version is [`v5.4.0-beta.1.d035.gd2e5001e7`](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaRelease/releases/tag/v5.4.0-beta.1.d035.gd2e5001e7); the last available .NET 4.8 version is [`v4.28.8`](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/releases/tag/v4.28.8). The feasibility of self-compilation has not yet been determined.

For Windows 7, before installing the two runtime libraries mentioned above, you also need to check if the following patches are installed:

1. [Windows 7 Service Pack 1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/b3da2c0f-cdb6-0572-8596-bab972897f61)

##### .NET 8 applications running on Windows 7 mitigation measures [#8238](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/issues/8238)

When running .NET 8 applications on Windows 7, there is an issue with abnormal memory usage. Please refer to the following mitigation measures. Windows 8/8.1 has not been tested. If the same issue exists, please kindly submit an issue to remind us to update the documentation.

1. Open `Computer`, right-click on the blank space, click Properties, click `Advanced system settings` on the left, and click `Environment Variables`.
2. Create a new system variable, variable name `DOTNET_EnableWriteXorExecute`, variable value `0`.
3. Restart the computer.

## Connection Error

- Tips: please refer to the [List of the Supported Emulators](./device/) section to ensure that the emulator you are using is officially supported and that your configuration is correct.
- If you are using software such as a game accelerator, please close the software, RESTART your computer and try again.
- Please check your decompression software - in some cases, using uncommon software such as `7z` or _other niche decompression software_ may cause errors in Minitouch-related files.

### Make sure ADB and address are correct

Check [Connection](./connection.md)

### Change emulator

Change to another emulator, such as [Bluestacks international version](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) Nougat 64 bit.

_After installation of Bluestack, you need to enable `Android Debug Bridge` in the settings._

### Close extra adb processes

- Close MAA and check for any adb processes in the task manager. If there are any, please close them and retry.

### Restart computer

Try restarting your computer.

## Connected successfully, then stuck, not operating at all

The adb version packaged with some emulators is too old and does not support minitouch. Please open MAA with administrator privileges and navigate to `Settings` - `Connection Settings` - `Forced Replace ADB`. (It is recommended to close the emulator and restart MAA before proceeding, otherwise, the replacement may not be successful.)

The emulator will reset the ADB version after updating. If the problems occur again, please repeat the above steps. Or you can try to use the [custom connection](./connection.md) method to solve it once and for all.

If it still doesn't work, please retry after switching to `MaaTouch` from `Minitouch` in `Settings` - `Connection Settings`.

## Connected successfully, but actions are slow or errors are frequent

- The Copilot requires you to go to the screen with the `Start` button. Please confirm they are not related.
- If you are using a non-CN client, please go to MAA Settings - Start-Up Settings - Select your client version. Not all features are currently supported for non-CN clients, please refer to docs.
- If you are running the Auto-I.S. function, please PIN UP the I.S. theme you want in the game, and select I.S. theme in MAA `Task Settings` - `Auto I.S.`.
- If Copilot frequently pauses without deploying operators, please disable `Pause Deployment` in `Settings` - `Game Settings`.
- If Auto Squad fails to recognize operators properly, please cancel the special focus on the corresponding operators.
- The input method `Adb Input` is naturally slow. It is recommended to use `MaaTouch` or `Minitouch` instead.

### Prompt that the screenshot takes a long time / is too long

- MAA currently supports 3 screenshot methods: `RawByNc`, `RawWithGzip`, and `Encode`. When the average screenshot time of executing a task is >400 / >800, a prompt message will be output (a single task will only be output once).
- `Settings - Connection Settings` will display the minimum/average/maximum time taken for the last 30 screenshots, refreshed every 10 screenshots.
- Automatic combat functions (such as I.S.) are greatly affected by the time taken to take screenshots.
- This time consumption is unrelated to MAA, but related to computer performance, current usage, or emulator. You can try cleaning up background processes, changing emulators, or upgrading computer configurations.

## About Windows UAC

MAA should not require Windows UAC administrator privileges to run all functions. The functionalities related to administrator privileges are as follows:

1. `Auto Detect Connection`: Administrator privileges are required when the target emulator is running with administrator rights.
2. `Close Emulator After Completion`: Administrator privileges are required when the target emulator is running with administrator rights.
3. `Start MAA Automatically on Boot`: It is not possible to set automatic startup with administrator privileges.
4. When MAA is incorrectly extracted to a path that requires administrator privileges for writing, such as `C:\` or `C:\Program Files\`.

There have been reports that systems with UAC disabled may have the issue where "even without selecting 'Run as Administrator' by right-clicking, it will still run with administrator privileges." It is recommended to enable UAC to avoid unintended privilege escalation.

## The download speed is slow and the mirror site is not accessible

1. Go to [Download](../readme.md) to get the link (non-mirror) you want to download.
2. Find the link to the file you need to download.
3. Right-click it and select `Copy link address`.
4. Paste the link into your browser.
5. Replace the `github.com` in the link with `download.fastgit.org`.
6. Press `Enter` to download.

## Download halfway and prompt "login"/"authentication"

Please use a browser / IDM / FDM and other regular downloaders to download files, **Do NOT fucking use Thunder!**
