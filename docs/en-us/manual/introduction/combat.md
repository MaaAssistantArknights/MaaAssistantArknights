# Combat

::: important This page may be outdated.
:::

## General Settings

- Combat options include `Use Sanity Potion + Use Originium`, `Perform Battles` and `Material`, you can specify any of them. The combat task stops once one of the specifications is met.

  - `Use Sanity Potion` specifies the maximum used amount of sanity potions. Multiple potions may be used at a time.
  - `Use Originium` specifies the maximum used amount of Originium. It is used one at a time. The Originium will not be used when there are Sanity Potions in the depot.
  - `Perform Battles` specifies the number of battles to perform at most.
  - `Material` specifies the number of materials to collect.

- `Material` and `Stage` are independent options. `Material` is not going to automatically navigate to the stage for the specified material. You still need to manually configure the stage option.
- `Use Originium` will only be used after `Use Sanity Option`, because MAA will only use Originium to replenish sanity when there are no Sanity Potions left. Therefore, after checking `Use Originium`, MAA will lock the number of `Use Sanity Potion` to 999, making sure to consume all the Sanity Potions to avoid skipping the `Use Originium` judgment.

::: details Example
| Use Sanity Potion | Use Originium | Perform Battles | Material | Result |
| :------: | :----: | :------: | :------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| | | | | Ends after using up the existing Sanity. |
| 2 | | | | Uses up the existing Sanity first, then consumes a Sanity Potion once, totalling `2` times. Ends after using up the Sanity. |
| _999_ | 2 | | | Uses up the existing Sanity and all Sanity Potions, then uses Originium, totalling `2` times. Ends after using up the Sanity. |
| | | 2 | | Ends after performing the selected stage `2` times. |
| | | | 2 | Ends after farming and obtaining `2` of the specified materials. |
| 2 | | 4 | | Ends after performing the selected stage `4` times, using up to `2` Sanity Potions. |
| 2 | | | 4 | Ends after farming and obtaining `4` of the specified materials, using up to `2` Sanity Potions. |
| 2 | | 4 | 8 | Ends after performing the selected stage `4` times, using up to `2` Sanity Potions. However, if `8` of the specified materials are obtained before completing `4` times, it will end early. |
| _999_ | 4 | 8 | 16 | Ends after performing the selected stage `8` times, using up all Sanity Potions and `4` Originium. However, if `16` of the specified materials are obtained before completing `8` times, it will end early. |
| | 2 | | | Uses up the existing Sanity first. If there are Sanity Potions in storage, it ends; if there are no Sanity Potions, it uses `2` Originium and ends after using up the Sanity. _Not a MAA GUI behavior_ |
| 2 | 4 | | | Uses up the existing Sanity first. If there are still some left after consuming `2` Sanity Potions, it ends; if there are no Sanity Potions after consuming â‰¤`2` Sanity Potions, it continues to use `4` Originium and ends after using up the Sanity. _Not a MAA GUI behavior_ |

### Operations

- If the stage you need is unavailable in the selection, please choose `Cur/Last` in MAA and manually locate the stage in the game.
  Ensure the screen stays on the stage detail page with the **Start** and **Auto-Deploy** buttons available.
- If you are not on this page, `Cur/Last` will automatically navigate to the last stage played according to the record in the lower right corner of the terminal homepage.
- You can also enable `Manual entry of stage names` in `Combat` - `Advanced` and enter the stage number manually. Currently supported stages include:
  - All main theme stages, where `-NORMAL` or `-HARD` can be added at the end to switch between standard and challenge modes.
  - LMD stages and Battle Record stages 5/6. The input must be `CE-6` or `LS-6` even if you have not unlocked it yet. In that case, the program will automatically switch to the corresponding stage 5.
  - Skill Summary, Shop Voucher, and Carbon Stages 5. The input also must be `CA-5`, `AP-5`, and `SK-5` respectively.
  - Chip stages. The input must be complete with stage number, such as `PR-A-1`.
  - Annihilation. The input must be `Annihilation`.
  - Some side story stages, now contains `OF-1`, `OF-F3` and `GT-5`.
  - The last three stages of the current SS event. This is available after downloading updates automatically from the [API](https://ota.maa.plus/MaaAssistantArknights/api/gui/StageActivity.json) when the event is on. The prompt will be shown on the main page when this is available.
  - For the SS event rerun, you can enter `SSReopen-XX` to clear XX-1 ~ XX-9 levels once. Example `SSReopen-IC`.

### Annihilation Mode

- MAA will only navigate through the Annihilation button at the top right corner of the terminal homepage. Please ensure that the current Annihilation has unlocked `Full Delegation` and that you possess a sufficient number of "PRTS Proxy Annihilation Cards".
- After the current Annihilation refreshes or after reinstalling Arknights, returning from the Annihilation `Start Battle` page will automatically LSand `Intelligence Summary`. Please close this page in advance to prevent the task from getting stuck.
- It is only recommended for players who have already achieved "400 kills" in the current Annihilation to use MAA for automatic Annihilation.

## Advanced Settings

### Alternative Stage

The alternative stage is determined based on the availability of stages on the given day, i.e., the first available stage will be selected for battle.
This is a function similar to a schedule and cannot be used as a backup stage when the stage selection task fails.

1. Example: Stage selection `CE-6/5`, alternatives `1-7` and `LS-6/5`:
   - If `CE-6/5` is available on the day, it will proceed to `CE-6/5` and not to `1-7` or `LS-6/5`. If the player has not unlocked the `CE-6/5` mission node, the sanity farming task will fail.
   - If `CE-6/5` is not available on the day, it will proceed to `1-7` and not to `CE-6/5`. If the player has not unlocked the 1-7 mission node, the sanity farming task will fail.
   - Since `1-7` is a permanent stage before `LS-6/5`, MAA will never proceed to `LS-6/5` in this scenario.
2. If the stage selection is `Annihilation`, then:
   - The selection logic of the remaining backup stages will not be affected by the result of the Annihilation, even if the Annihilation fails, the sanity farming task will not fail.
   - The remaining backup stages will only inherit the settings of `Use Sanity Potion` and `Series`, and will not be controlled by `Use Originium`, `Perform Battles`, or `Material`.

### Remaining Sanity

It starts after the `Combat` task ends and is not controlled by `Use Sanity Potion`, `Use Originium`, `Perform Battles`, `Material`, or `Series`. It ends when the current remaining sanity is exhausted.

- Suitable for clearing the remaining "corner" sanity (e.g., going to 1-7) after sanity is insufficient in the `Stage Selection` stage.
- Also suitable for automatically using single battles to use up sanity when the set number of consecutive battles is too high and sanity is insufficient (e.g., setting 1-7 to battle 6 times, but only having 30 sanity, thus automatically switching to 5 single battles of 1-7).
- If the remaining sanity is still insufficient, the task will end (e.g., less than 6 sanity).
- If the selected stage for remaining sanity is unopened, the sanity farming task will fail.

### Series

- MAA currently only performs consecutive battles according to the number of times set by the user and does not yet support automatic recognition of the maximum number of consecutive battles.
- If the set number of times is too high but sanity is insufficient, MAA will directly perform the `Use Sanity Potion` or `Use Originium` operation and continue to attempt consecutive battles.
- If `Use Sanity Potion` or `Use Originium` is not set, MAA will directly consider sanity insufficient and terminate the sanity farming task. If `Remaining Sanity` is set, MAA will directly start farming the `Remaining Sanity` stages.

### Drop Recognition

- Material drops are automatically recognized and printed to the program log. The data also gets uploaded to [Penguin Stats](https://penguin-stats.io/) and [Yituliu](https://ark.yituliu.cn/).
- You can manually set your Penguin Stats user ID in the settings.

## Abnormal Detection

- `Auto-Deploy` will be automatically selected if not already in case you forget to do so.
- After disconnection or forced server reset at 4 am, it will automatically reconnect and continue to play the last stage selected in the game. If you need to cross the day, please check the last stage selection.
- An account level-up situation can be automatically handled as well as a failed operation in which case the operation will be abandoned and the battle will be retried.
