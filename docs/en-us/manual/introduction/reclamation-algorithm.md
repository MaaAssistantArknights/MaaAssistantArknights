# Reclamation Algorithm

Currently, support for Reclamation Algorithm is still in early stages and unattended operation is not recommended, as stability cannot be guaranteed at this time.

## Default Mode

1. You need to start the task from the Reclamation Algorithm main interface (navigation not yet implemented)
2. Cannot be used when you already have an existing save file (delete the existing save to use)
3. Cannot be used when operators are present in the Reclamation Algorithm squad (clear the current squad, especially after completing a wave)

## Manufacturing Points Farm

1. You need to start from the page where you can see the base camp after entering Reclamation Algorithm
2. If no item name is specified, Glow Sticks will be crafted by default
3. Prerequisite: It must be the first day after settlement, with no enemy raids entering the base camp for the next three days
4. If the manufacturable quantity is exactly a multiple of 99, the process may get stuck. You can use up a small amount before saving; this issue will be fixed in the future
