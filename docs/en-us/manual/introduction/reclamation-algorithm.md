Currently, the support for Integrated Strategies is still in the early stages, and it is not recommended to run it unattended. Stability cannot be guaranteed at this stage.

## Default Mode

1. You need to start the task on the main interface of Integrated Strategies. (navigation is not yet written)
2. Cannot be used if there is already a save file. (just delete the existing save file)
3. Cannot be used if there are operators in the Integrated Strategies squad. (just clear the current squad in Integrated Strategies, especially after finishing a wave)

## Manufacturing Points

1. You need to start on the page where you can see the base camp after entering Integrated Strategies.
2. If the item name is not filled in, the default is to manufacture glow sticks.
3. Prerequisite: It is the first day after settlement, and there are no enemy raids entering the base camp for the next three days.
4. If the number that can be manufactured is exactly a multiple of 99, it will get stuck. You can use up a bit before saving, this will be fixed later.
