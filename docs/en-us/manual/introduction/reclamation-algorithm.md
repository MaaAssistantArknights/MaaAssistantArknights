# Reclamation Algorithm (R.A.)

::: important This page may be outdated and not yet implemented for Global.
:::

Currently, the support for Reclamation Algorithm is still in the early stages, and it is not recommended to run it unattended. Stability cannot be guaranteed at this stage.

## Default Mode

1. You need to start the task on the main interface of R.A.. (navigation is not yet written)
2. Cannot be used if there is already a save file. (just delete the existing save file)
3. Cannot be used if there are operators in the R.A. squad. (just clear the current squad in R.A., especially after finishing a wave)

## Points farm through crafting

1. You need to start on the page where you can see the base camp after entering R.A..
2. If the item name is not filled in, the default is to craft Glow Sticks.
3. Prerequisite: It is the first day after settlement, and no enemy raids are entering the base camp for the next three days.
4. If the number that can be manufactured is exactly a multiple of 99, it will get stuck. You can use up a bit before saving, this will be fixed later.
