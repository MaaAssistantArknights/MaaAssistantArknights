- With the help of combat credit:
  - Use a support operator to clear the `OF-1` stage in Heart of Surging Flame. If the stage is not unlocked, please do not select this option.
  - It does not take effect when the stage selection is set to `Cur/Last`.

## Advanced Settings

- Whitelist and Blacklist are keyword matches, for example, filling in `碳` (Carbon Stick) will match `碳` (Carbon Stick) and `碳素` (Carbon Brick). May still require only the original Chinese as input.
- `Stop purchasing items when credits are below 300` will still purchase whitelist items even when below 300.
