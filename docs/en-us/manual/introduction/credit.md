# Credit Store

- Automatically visits friends to obtain credit points and shops at the credit store.
- Support for earning credits through combat:
  - MAA will use a support operator to clear the `OF-1` stage from Heart of Surging Flame. Please ensure this stage is unlocked.
  - This feature won't activate when the stage selection is set to `Current/Last`.

## Advanced Settings

- Both priority purchase items and blacklist use keyword matching. For example, entering `Carbon` will match both `Carbon Stick` and `Carbon Brick`.
- You can use either English semicolons `;` or Chinese semicolons `ï¼›` as separators.
- When `Stop purchasing items when credits are below 300` is enabled, priority purchase items will still be bought even when below 300 credits.
