## Recruitment Recognition

Open the Recruitment tag interface and click Start Recognition to initiate.

If you have previously run Operator Recognition, potential data will be displayed after the recognized operator's name.

## Operator Recognition (Beta)

Can recognize lists of both owned and unowned operators, and identify potential levels to provide data for Recruitment Recognition.

## Depot Recognition (Beta)

Supports automatically entering the depot from the main page. If automatic navigation fails, please manually switch to the `Upgrade Materials` screen and **scroll all the way to the left** before starting the function.

Currently supports exporting to [Penguin Statistics Planner](https://penguin-stats.io/planner), [Arknights Toolbox](https://arkntools.app/#/material), and [Arknights | Planner](https://ark-nights.com/settings).

If you are the administrator of a data site, we welcome you to contact us to adapt your site's material JSON protocol!

More useful features may be added in the future. (Teaser)

Can recognize strategy videos and automatically generate operation files. Simply drag video files into the Auto Combat page to start.

Couldn't join the MAA Gacha Party livestreams? No problem! Now you can have your own personal gacha assistant! Screenshots will be taken during the pulling process and displayed in the center of the interface!

## Peep

Want to see the world through MAA's eyes? Now you can!

MAA will attempt to take screenshots of the emulator at the target frame rate and display them in real-time in the window.

When the screenshot speed is significantly slower than the target frame rate, MAA will automatically reduce the target frame rate to match the screenshot speed. ~~Can be used as a stress test~~
