## Recruitment Recognition

Open the Recruit tag interface and click Start Recognition to initiate.

If you have previously run Operator recognition, potential data will be displayed after the recognized Operator's name.

## Operator Recognition (Beta)

Can recognize the list of owned and unowned Operators, and recognize and save potential data for display in Recruitment recognition.

## Depot Recognition (Beta)

Support automatically entering the depot from the main page. If the automatic jump fails, please manually switch to the `Upgrade materials` screen and slide to the far left to start the function.

Currently, exporting is supported to [Penguin-Stats](https://penguin-stats.cn/planner), [Arknights Toolbox](https://arkntools.app/#/material), and [Arknights | Planner](https://ark-nights.com/settings).

Please feel free to contact us if you hope to integrate with our JSON schema.

More useful features **may** be added in the future.
