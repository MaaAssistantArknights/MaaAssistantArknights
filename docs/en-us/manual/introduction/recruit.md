The Recruit option in the 'Farming' tab and [recruitment recognition](./tools.md#recruitment-recognition) are two different features, though most options from the tool are in the recruit option as well.

## Auto-recruitment

Auto-recruitment supports using `Expedited Plan` to make it fully automated. Please enable `Auto use Expedited Plan` and modify `Recruit max times` in `Recruit` - `General`.

Pop-up notification when 1★, 5★, 6★ operators are recruited.

Auto-uploading recruitment data to [Penguin Stats](https://penguin-stats.io/) and [Yituliu](https://ark.yituliu.cn/) while auto-recruitment.

## Advanced Settings

`Auto confirm` means MAA automatically selects tags and recruits, while `Manually confirm` means no automatic selection and recruitment.
