# Recruitment

Auto Recruitment and [Recruitment Recognition](./tools.md#recruitment-recognition) are two different features!

## Auto Recruitment

Supports automatic use of `Expedited Plans`, allows setting maximum recruitment times per task, and can be combined with `Auto use Expedited Plans` to quickly use up all recruitment permits.

Pop-up notifications will appear when 1★, 5★, or 6★ tags are detected.

Recruitment tag data is automatically uploaded to [Penguin Statistics](https://penguin-stats.io/) and [Yituliu](https://ark.yituliu.cn/) when refreshing recruitment.

## Advanced Settings

`Auto confirm` means MAA automatically selects tags and performs recruitment, while `Manual confirm` means no automatic tag selection or recruitment is performed.
