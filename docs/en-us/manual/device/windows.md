_TODO: replace these Chinese emulators links with English ones_

The following emulators are displayed randomly in no particular order.

Since Hyper-V runs as administrator, operations that don\'t involve adb such as auto-shutdown of the emulator, auto-detect connection, etc. also need to run MAA as administrator.',
