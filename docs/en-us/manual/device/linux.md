# Linux Emulator and Container

## Preparation

You can choose one of the following installation methods:

### Use maa-cli

[maa-cli](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/maa-cli) is a simple CLI for MAA made with Rust. Please read installation and usage tutorials in [User Guide for CLI](../cli/).

### Use Wine

The MAA WPF GUI can currently be run using Wine.

#### Installation Steps

1. Go to the [.NET Release Page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) to download and install the .NET **Desktop** Runtime for Windows.

2. Download MAA for Windows, unzip it and run `wine MAA.exe`.

::: info Note
You need to set the ADB path to [`adb.exe` for Windows](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) in the connection settings.

If you need to connect to USB devices via ADB, please run `adb start-server` outside of Wine first, i.e. connect to the native ADB server via Wine.
:::

#### Use Linux native MaaCore (experimental feature)

Download the [MAA Wine Bridge](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/tree/dev/src/MaaWineBridge) source and build it, replace the Windows version with the generated `MaaCore.dll` (ELF file) in the same directory as the Linux native dynamic libraries (`libMaaCore.so` and dependencies).

Running `MAA.exe` through Wine will load the Linux native libraries.

::: info Note
To use Linux native MaaCore, you need to set the ADB path to Linux native ADB in the connection settings.
:::

#### Linux Desktop Integration (experimental feature)

Desktop integration provides native desktop notification support and the ability to map fontconfig font configurations to WPF.

Enable it by placing `MaaDesktopIntegration.so` generated by MAA Wine Bridge in the same directory as `MAA.exe`.

#### Known Issues

- Wine DirectWrite forces hinting to be enabled and does not pass DPI to FreeType, resulting in poor font display.
- When not using native desktop notifications, the popup notification will grab the system-wide mouse focus, making it impossible to operate other windows. This can be mitigated by enabling virtual desktop mode via `winecfg`, or disabling desktop notifications.
- Wine-staging users need to disable the `Hide Wine Version` option in `winecfg` in order for MAA to properly detect the Wine environment.
- Wine's Light theme causes some text colours in WPF to be abnormal, it is recommended to switch to no theme (Windows Classic theme) in `winecfg`.
- Wine uses the old XEmbed tray icon, which may not work properly under GNOME.
- Auto-update is not supported when using Linux native MaaCore (~~Updater: I think I should download a Windows version~~).

### Use Python

#### 1. Installing dynamic library

1. Download and extract `Linux library` in [MAA Website](https://maa.plus/), or install from linux software repository:

   - AUR：[maa-assistant-arknights](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/maa-assistant-arknights), edit the script according to the post-install instruction.
   - Nixpkgs: [maa-assistant-arknights](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-unstable/pkgs/by-name/ma/maa-assistant-arknights/package.nix)

2. Open `sample.py` in `./MAA-v{VERSION}-linux-{ARCH}/Python/`

> **Note**
> The precompiled version is built in a relatively new distro (Ubuntu 22.04), you may run into binary compatability problem, if libstdc++ in your environment is too old.
> Where you should reference to [Linux tutorial](../../develop/linux-tutorial.md), or run inside a container instead.

#### 2. `adb` Settings

1. Target to [`if asst.connect('adb.exe', '127.0.0.1:5554'):`](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/blob/722f0ddd4765715199a5dc90ea1bec2940322344/src/Python/sample.py#L48)

2. `adb` Tools Settings

   - If you use `avd` in `Android Studio` as your emulator, it contains `adb` that you can use it directly. Just fill in your `adb` path in `adb.exe`, you can usually find it in `$HOME/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/` , eg.:

    ```python
    if asst.connect("/home/foo/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb", "avd_ID"):
    ```

   - If you use other emulators, you have to install `adb` first: `$ sudo apt install adb` and then fill in the path of adb or just fill in `adb` if you had put it into the `PATH` environment variable.

3. Emulator `adb` ID Settings

   - You can use the adb tool directly: `$ ${adb_path} devices` , eg.:

    ```shell
    $ /home/foo/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb devices
    List of devices attached
    emulator-5554 device
    ```

   - `emulator-5554` that the terminal returns is the ID of emulator adb, replacing `127.0.0.1:5555` with it, eg.：

    ```python
    if asst.connect("/home/foo/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb", "emulator-5554"):
    ```

4. Now you can test: `$ python3 sample.py` , if return `连接成功` , you almost finish setting.

#### 3. Tasks Settings

Customizing tasks: Reference to [AsstAppendTask](../../protocol/integration.md#asstappendtask) and modify [`# 任务及参数请参考 docs/集成文档.md`](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/blob/722f0ddd4765715199a5dc90ea1bec2940322344/src/Python/sample.py#L54) section in `sample.py`.

## Emulator Supports

### ✅ [AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)

Requests: Resolution should be 16:9 and above 720p

Recommendation: x86\_64 architecture (R - 30 - x86\_64 - Android 11.0) with `Linux x64 动态库` in MAA

### ⚠️ [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/)

Native x86\_64 architecture in high version of Android, light weight but easy to crash when running Arknights.

We have not testing strictly, but adb functions and path have no error.

## Containerized Android

> **Note**
> The following solutions are likely to depend on special kernel modules, make sure to have them installed accordingly.

### ✅ [Waydroid](https://waydro.id/)

Need to reset the resolution to 16:9 (You can set it above 720P):

```shell
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.width 1280
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.height 720
```

After restarting, record `IP address` in `Setting` - `About phone` , fill `${IP address}:5555` to the adb IP address in `sample.py` .

If you are using amdgpu, `screencap` command may write messages to stderr, causing image decoding error.
Run `adb exec-out screencap | xxd | head` to check if there is something like `/vendor/etc/hwdata/amdgpu.ids: No such file...` in the output.
Modify screencap commands in `resource/config.json` from `adb exec-out screencap` to `adb exec-out 'screencap 2>/dev/null'` as a workaround.

### ✅ [redroid](https://github.com/remote-android/redroid-doc)

Arknights runs properly in Android 11 image. Do remember to expose port 5555 for adb.
