# Getting Started

## Preparation

1. Confirm system version

    MAA only supports Windows 10 / 11. For earlier versions of Windows, please refer to [FAQ](./faq.md) at the top.

    Non-Windows users, please refer to [Emulator and Device Supports](./device/).

2. Install the runtime library

    MAA requires VCRedist x64 and .NET 8. Right-click the start button to open the terminal, paste the following command in it and Enter to install.

    ```sh
    winget install Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64 Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.8
    ```

    Refer to [FAQ](faq.md#missing-runtime-libraries) for more information

3. Download the correct version

    [MAA official website](https://maa.plus/) will automatically select the correct version architecture, which for most users reading this article should be Windows x64.

4. Unzip correctly

    Verify that the extraction is complete and make sure to extract the MAA to a separate folder. Do not extract MAA to a path that requires UAC permissions such as `C:\`, `C:\Program Files\`, etc.

5. Confirm simulator support

    Check [Emulator Supports](./device/) to confirm the support of the emulator you are using.

6. Correctly set the emulator resolution

    The emulator resolution should be `16:9` ratio, with a minimum of `1280x720`; for YostarEN, the only supported resolution is `1920x1080`.

## Initial

0. If you'd like to use automatic detection, run **one** emulator and make sure no other Android devices are connected to the computer.

1. Follow the setup guide to configure, and MAA will automatically detect the running emulator. If the detection fails or you'd like to run multiple emulators, please check [Connection](./connection.md).

2. ~~A hot update will be performed when MAA is run for the first time. Please close MAA and restart after prompting in the log on the right.~~

3. Drag the task list on the left to sort the tasks, and check or uncheck the checkboxes to select
   the tasks to be run.

4. Link Start!

## Advanced configuration

Check out the documentation.

## Other

::: center
**When encountering problems, read the documents please.**
:::

1. The log files are located in the folder under the MAA folder which is named `debug`. Logs are important. When asking others for help, be sure to take `asst.log` and `gui.log` with you.

2. To meet the various needs of all users as much as possible, MAA provides a large number of customization options. When you find that MAA lacks a certain function, it may be because it is not easily discoverable rather than non-existent, such as `Manual entry of stage names` and `Do not put stationed operators in Dormitory`.

3. Placing the mouse pointer on some options will give detailed instructions, such as `Do not put stationed operators in Dormitory`.

4. For some checkboxes, right-click on them to change them to a half-selected state. The checkboxes in this state will be automatically cleared the next time MAA is started, which can be understood as `only once`.

5. ~~If you're uncertain about your needs, don't select the Nightly Release.~~
