# Task Schema

Usage of `resource/tasks.json` and description of each field

## Overview

```jsonc

                                            // Tasks to be executed after reaching `maxTimes`, optional
                                            // Stops the task if empty; otherwise, proceeds with the tasks here in the list instead of `next`.
        "onErrorNext": [ "OtherTaskName1", "OtherTaskName2" ],
                                            // Proceeding tasks when there are errors, optional

                                            // Reducing the region has the effect of reducing performance consumption and speeding up the recognition.

        "cache": true,                      // Whether the task uses cache, optional; `true` by default 
                                            // After a successful recognition, subsequent recognition will be done only in the region cached, which has a significant performance enhancement.
                                            // Only for targets that do not change position. Please set it to `false` for targets with changing position.

                                            // It is suggested that it should recognize the target to click instead of using this field.

                                            // Reducing execution counter of other tasks after execution, optional
                                            // E.g. Using sanity potion means clicking the blue start button did not take effect so the counter of the starting task should be reduced by 1.

        "specificRect": [ 100, 100, 50, 50],
                                            // Available only when `action` is `ClickRect`, indicating the position to click (random position within the region), required.
                                            // Auto-scaled based on 1280 * 720 resolution.
        
        /* Available only when `algorithm` is `MatchTemplate` */

        "templThreshold": 0.8,              // Threshold of image recognition, optional. Image is matched only when the similarity is greater than the threshold.
                                            // 0.8 by default. You can check it in the logs.

        "maskRange": [ 1, 255 ],            // Grayscale mask range, optional. E.g. fill in the region that does not require recognition with black colour,
                                            // and set it to [ 1, 255 ] so that the black region is ignored.


        /* Available only when `algorithm` is `OcrDetect` */

        "fullMatch": false,                 // Whether the text recognition is full match, optional. `false` by default.
                                            // `false` means substring matches as well. E.g.: `text: [ "开始" ]` matches "开始行动";
                                            // `true` means, e.g. it must match "开始" without other characters.

        "ocrReplace": [                     // Text replacement for common wrong recognition of OCR (supporting RegExp)
            [ "千员", "干员" ],
            [ ".+击干员", "狙击干员" ]
        ]

        /* Available only when `algorithm` is `Hash` */
        // Development in progress, only used in some special cases, not recommended
        // Todo
    }
}
```

## Tips

- Put the name of the task itself in `next` for looping, for example:

```jsonc
{
    "Waiting": {
        "algorithm": "OcrDetect",
        "text": [ "正在加载" ],
        "next": [
            "Succeed",  // Matches "加载完成" first
            "Waiting"   // Otherwise matches "正在加载"
        ]
    },
    "Succeed": {
        "algorithm": "OcrDetect",
        "text": [ "加载完成" ],
        "next": [
            "OtherTask"
        ]
    }
}
```

- The `JustReturn` field of `algorithm` is not recommended to set as a loop. Otherwise recognition will be always successful in some cases like adb disconnection.

- Tasks that are required to be executed N times can be copied N times with different names. For example:

```jsonc
{
    "DoIt": {
        "next": [
            "DoItAgain"
        ]
    },
    "DoItAgain": {
        "next": [
            "OtherTask"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Schema Check

This project provides JSON schema check for `tasks.json`. The schema file can be found at `docs/maa_tasks_schema.json`.

### Visual Studio

Visual Studio has been configured with `MaaCore.vcxporj`. Developers should be able to use it directly after loading the project.

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code has been configured with `.vscode/settings.json`. Developeres can open the **project folder** to use it, with better experience than Visual Studio.
