# Frequently Asked Questions

## The program crashes immediately when I try to run it

### Possible cause 0: incomplete file downloaded

- If you are the first time using this software, please DO NOT download the zip file with `OTA` in the file name, which is for incremental update and shall not be used alone.
- If the application does not run properly after an automatic update, there may be some bugs in the automatic update function, and you can try to manually download the full version and try again.

### Possible cause 1: missing runtime libraries

 Please try installing [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-160#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022) and [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48), and restart your computer and the application.

### Possible cause 2: other runtime library problems

If you are a user of Windows Server or other lite versions, you can try [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) to configure a complete development environment (only .NET and C++ environments are required).

**Please note that you may need about 10GB disk space to install these tools. Please make sure that your free space is enough.**

## Connection error

Tips: please refer to the [List of the Supported Emulators](1.3-EMULATOR_SUPPORTS.md) section to ensure that you are using your emulator correctly. If you are using Bluestack, please enable `Android Debug Bridge` in the settings.  

If you are using software such as a game accelerator, please close the software and RESTART your computer and try again.

### Approach 1: make sure ADB and address are correct

- Make sure that MAA `Settings` - `Connection Settings` - `adb path` is automatically filled in. If so, skip to the next step. Otherwise:
  - Option 1: find the installation path of your emulator, where there may be a file named `adb.exe` (or something similar, e.g. `nox_adb.exe`, `HD-adb.exe`, `adb_server.exe`, etc., any EXE files with `adb`). Simply choose the file in the connection settings of MAA!
  - Option 2: download [adb](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) and unzip it. Select the `adb.exe` file.

- Confirm that your connection address is filled in correctly. The ADB address is usually like `127.0.0.1:5555`, depending on the emulators (except Leidian emulator).

### Approach 2: change emulator

Change to another emulator, such as [Bluestacks international version](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) Nougat 64 bit.

_After installation of Bluestack, you need to enable `Android Debug Bridge` in the settings._

### Approach 3: restart computer

Try restarting your computer.

## Connected successfully, then stuck, not operating at all

The adb version with some emulators is too old and does not support minitouch. Please open MAA with administrator and enter Settings - Connection Settings - Forced Replace ADB. (It is recommended to close the emulator and restart MAA before proceeding, otherwise the replacement may not be correct)

If still not work, please enable the "Compatibility Touch Mode" (without minitouch).

## Connected successfully, can click a few times, then stuck or task error

- The auto battle requires you to go to the screen with the `Start` button. Please confirm they are not related.
- If you are using a non-CN client, please go to MAA Settings - Start Up Settings - Select your client version. And not all features are supported for non-CN client, please refer to docs.
- If you are running auto-IS function, please PIN UP the IS theme you want in the game, and select IS theme in MAA Settings - IS Settings.

## Custom Connection

- Download [adb](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) and unzip it.
- Go to `Settings` - `Connection Settings`, and select the location of `adb.exe`, fill in the address of ADB (with the format of IP+port, e.g. `127.0.0.1:5555`), and choose the type of your emulator.

## The download speed is slow and the mirror site is not accessible

1. Go to [Download](../../README.md#Download) to get the link (non-mirror) to you want to download.
2. Find the link to your file you need to download.
3. Right-click it and select `Copy link address`.
4. Paste the link into your browser.
5. Replace the `github.com` in the link with `download.fastgit.org`.
6. Press `Enter` to download.

## Download halfway and prompt "login"/"authentication"

Please use a browser / IDM / FDM and other regular downloaders to download files, **Do NOT fucking use Thunder!**
