# Emulator Support for Linux

## Preparation

### 1. Installing

1. Download and extract `Linux 动态库` in [MAA Website](https://maa.plus/)

2. Open `sample.py` in `./MAA-v{VERSION}-linux-{ARCH}/Python/`

> **Note**
> The precompiled version is built in a relatively new distro (Ubuntu 22.04), you may run into binary compatability problem, if libstdc++ in your environment is too old.
> Where you should reference to [Linux tutorial](./2.1-LINUX_TUTORIAL.md), or run inside a container instead.

- If you are running an Arch based distro, you may install from aur [maa-assistant-arknights](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/maa-assistant-arknights),
  and edit the script according to the post-install instruction.

### 2. `adb` Settings

1. Target to [`if asst.connect('adb.exe', '127.0.0.1:5554'):`](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/blob/722f0ddd4765715199a5dc90ea1bec2940322344/src/Python/sample.py#L48)

2. `adb` Tools Settings

   - If you use `avd` in `Android Studio` as your emulator, it contains `adb` that you can use it directly. Just fill in your `adb` path in `adb.exe`, you can usually find it in `$HOME/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/` , eg.:

    ```python
    if asst.connect("/home/foo/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb", "avd_ID"):
    ```

   - If you use other emulators, you have to install `adb` first: `$ sudo apt install adb` and then fill in the path of adb or just fill in `adb` if you had put it into the `PATH` environment variable.

3. Emulator `adb` ID Settings

   - You can use the adb tool directly: `$ ${adb_path} devices` , eg.:

    ```shell
    $ /home/foo/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb devices
    List of devices attached
    emulator-5554 device
    ```

   - `emulator-5554` that the terminal returns is the ID of emulator adb, replacing `127.0.0.1:5555` with it, eg.：

    ```python
    if asst.connect("/home/foo/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb", "emulator-5554"):
    ```

4. Now you can test: `$ python3 sample.py` , if return `连接成功` , you almost finish setting.

### 3. Tasks Settings

Customizing tasks: Reference to [AsstAppendTask](https://maa.plus/docs/en-us/3.1-INTEGRATION.html#asstappendtask) and modify [`# 任务及参数请参考 docs/集成文档.md`](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/blob/722f0ddd4765715199a5dc90ea1bec2940322344/src/Python/sample.py#L54) section in `sample.py`.

## Emulator Supports

### ✅ [AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)

Requests: Resolution should be 16:9 and above 720p

Recommendation: x86\_64 architecture (R - 30 - x86\_64 - Android 11.0) with `Linux x64 动态库` in MAA

### ⚠️ [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/)

Native x86\_64 architecture in high version of Android, light weight but easy to crash when running Arknights.

We have not testing strictly, but adb functions and path have no error.

## Containerized Android

> **Note**
> The following solutions are likely to depend on special kernel modules, make sure to have them installed accordingly.

### ✅ [Waydroid](https://waydro.id/)

Need to reset the resolution to 16:9 (You can set it above 720P):

```shell
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.width 1280
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.height 720
```

After restarting, record `IP address` in `Setting` - `About phone` , fill `${IP address}:5555` to the adb IP address in `sample.py` .

### ✅ [redroid](https://github.com/remote-android/redroid-doc)

Arknights runs properly in Android 11 image. Do remember to expose port 5555 for adb.
