- Navbar/Sidebar: Set icons displayed in the navbar and sidebar.

- Document content: Use icons in the document content.

### Setting Document Icons

You can use `icon` in the document's [frontmatter](#frontmatter) to set the document's icon.

This icon will be displayed next to the document title.

### Using Icons in Documents

You can use the `<HopeIcon />` component to add icons in markdown. This component has the following attributes:

- `icon`: Accepts icon keywords and URLs, such as `jam:write-f`, `ic:round-home`, etc.
- `color`: Accepts CSS-style color values, such as `#fff`, `red`, etc. (This option only works for SVG icons).
- `size`: Accepts CSS-style sizes, such as `1rem`, `2em`, `100px`, etc.

::: details Example
<HopeIcon icon="ic:round-home" color="#1f1e33"/>

```markdown
<HopeIcon icon="ic:round-home" color="#1f1e33"/>
```

<HopeIcon icon="/image/maa-logo_512x512.png" size="4rem" />
```markdown
<HopeIcon icon="/image/maa-logo_512x512.png" size="4rem" />
```

### Obtaining Icon Keywords

The icons used in this document are from [iconify](https://iconify.design/). You can search for the icons you want in its provided [icon search interface](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) and then copy their keywords.

## Frontmatter

Frontmatter is the content at the beginning of a Markdown document enclosed in `---,` using YAML syntax internally. Through frontmatter, we can identify the document's editing time, the icon used, the classification, tags, etc.

```markdown
---
date: 1919-08-10
icon: jam:write-f
