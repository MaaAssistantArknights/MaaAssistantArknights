# Development

## Introduction to GitHub pull request flow

1. If you have forked this repository long time ago, please go to `Settings`, scroll down to the bottom, and click `Delete Repository`.
2. Go to [MAA main repository](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights) and click `Fork`, then `Create fork`.
3. Clone the `dev` branch of the (forked) repository to local:

    ```bash
    git clone <link to your forked repo> -b dev
    ```

4. Download pre-built third-party libraries

    **Please install Python first if you don't have it.**

    ```cmd
    python maadeps-download.py
    ```

5. Configure development environment

    1. Download and install `Visual Studio 2022 Community`. Select `Desktop development with C++` and `.NET Desktop Development`.

6. Double-click to open the file `MAA.sln`. Visual Studio will load the project automatically.
7. Run a build to test whether the development environment has been configured correctly. Choose `Release` & `x64`, right-click `MaaWpfGui` to set it as the startup project, and run it. If the build is successful, the `MaaWpfGui` window will appear. You can connect to the emulator in order to confirm again that the development environment has been configured correctly.
8. Now you are free to contribute to MAA.
9. Remember to commit once you have proper number of changes. Don't forget to write a commit message.

    If you are a beginner of git, you might want to make changes on a newly created branch instead of committing to `dev` directly

    ```bash
    git branch your_own_branch
    git checkout your_own_branch
    ```

    so that your new commits would grow on the new branch, without being interrupted by updates of `dev`

10. After development, push your local changes to the remote (your own repository).

    ```bash
    git push origin dev
    ```

11. Go to [MAA repository](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights) and submit a Pull Request. Wait until the administrator approves it. Please note that the changes should be based on `dev` instead of `master` branch, and should be merged to `dev` branch as well.
12. When there are changes from other contributors on upstreaming MAA repository, it might be necessary for you to add them to your own branch.
    1. Add MAA upstream repository.

        ```bash
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights.git
        ```

    2. Fetch upstream changes from the repository.

        ```bash
        git fetch upstream
        ```

    3. rebase (recommended) or merge changes.

        ```bash
        git rebase upstream/dev
        ```

        or

        ```bash
        git merge
        ```

    4. Repeat step 7-10.

Note: operations regarding Git can be done by VS2022 instead of command line tools, using the Git changes tab.

## Enable clang-format in Visual Studio

1. Download [clang-format.zip](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights/files/9482197/clang-format.zip) or compile [zzyyyl/llvm-project](https://github.com/zzyyyl/llvm-project/tree/fix/clang-format). You will get a `clang-format.exe`.
2. Search `clang-format` in `Tools`-`Options`.
3. Click `Enable ClangFormat` and select `Use custom clang-format.exe file` to use the `clang-format.exe` you have got in Step 1.

You are all set with the clang-format integrated in Visual Studio supporting c++20 features!

You can also format with `tools\ClangFormatter\clang-formatter.py` directly, by executing in the root folder of the project:

- `python tools\ClangFormatter\clang-formatter.py --clang-format=PATH\TO\YOUR\clang-format.exe --input=src\MaaCore`
