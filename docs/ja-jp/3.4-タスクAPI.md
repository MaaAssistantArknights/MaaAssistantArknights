# Task Schema

Usage of `resource/tasks.json` and description of each field

## Overview

## Special Task Type

### Template Task(`@` Type Task)

Template task and base task are collectively called **Template task**.

Allows a task "A" to be used as a template, and then "B@A" to represent the task generated by "A".

- If task "B@A" is not explicitly defined in `tasks.json`, then add `B@` prefix to the `sub`, `next`, `onErrorNext`, `exceededNext`, `reduceOtherTimes` fields (or `B` if the task name starts with `#`) and the rest of the parameters are the same as for task "A". That is, if task "A" has the following parameters.

    ```json
    "A": {
        "template": "A.png",
        ...,
        "next": [ "N1", "N2" ]
    }
    ```

    is equivalent to defining both

    ```json
    "B@A": {
        "template": "A.png",
        ...,
        "next": [ "B@N1", "B@N2" ]
    }
    ```

- If task "B@A" is defined in `tasks.json`, then
  1. if the `algorithm` field of `B@A` is different from that of `A`, the derived class parameters are not inherited (only the parameters defined by `TaskInfo` are inherited)
  2. for image matching task, `template` is `B@A.png` if not explicitly defined (instead of inheriting the `template` name of "A"), otherwise any derived class parameters are inherited directly from "A" task if not explicitly defined
  3. for the parameters defined in the `TaskInfo` base class (any type of task parameters, such as `algorithm`, `roi`, `next`, etc.), if not explicitly defined in "B@A", all parameters are inherited directly from the "A" task parameters, except for the five fields mentioned above, such as `sub`, which will be prefixed with "B@" when inherited

### Base Task

Base task and template task are collectively called **template task**.

A task with the field `baseTask` is a base task.

Base task takes precedence over template task. This means that `"B@A": { "baseTask": "C", ... }` has no relevance to task A.

Any parameter that is not explicitly defined uses the value of the `baseTask` parameter for the corresponding task without a prefix, except for `template` which remains `"taskName.png"` if it is not explicitly defined.

#### Multi-File Task

If a task defined in a later loaded task file (e.g. `tasks.json` for foreign services; hereinafter called File 2) also has a task of the same name defined in a earlier loaded task file (e.g. `tasks.json` for official services; hereinafter called File 1), then.
- if the task in File 2 does not have a `baseTask` field, then it inherits the fields of the task with the same name in File 1 directly.
- If the task in File 2 has a `baseTask` field, then it does not inherit the fields of the task with the same name in File 1, but overwrites them.

### Virtual Task

Virtual task is also called sharp task (`#` type task).

A task with `#` in its name is a virtual task. `#` can be followed by `next`, `back`, `self`, `sub`, `on_error_next`, `exceeded_next`, `reduce_other_times`。

| Virtual Task Type | Meaning | Simple example |
|:---------:|:---:|:--------:|
| self | Parent Task Name | `"A": {"next": "#self"}` in `"#self"` is interpreted as `"A"`<br>`"B": {"next": "A@B@C#self"}` in `"A@B@C#self"` is interpreted as `"B"`.<sup>1</sup> |
| back | # Preceding task name | `"A@B#back"` is interpreted as `"A@B"`<br>`"#back"` will be skipped if it appears directly |
| next, sub, etc. | # The field corresponding to the previous task name | Take `next` for example:<br>`"A#next"` is interpreted as `Task.get("A")->next`<br>`"#next"` will be skipped if it appears directly |

_Note<sup>1</sup>: `"XXX#self"` has the same meaning as `"#self"`._

#### Simple example

```json
{
    "A": { "next": [ "N1", "N2" ] },
    "C": { "next": [ "B@A#next" ] },

    "Loading": {
        "next": [ "#self", "#next", "#back" ]
    },
    "B": {
        "next": [ "Other", "B@Loading" ]
    }
}
```

Available.

```cpp
Task.get("C")->next = { "B@N1", "B@N2" };

Task.get("B@Loading")->next = { "B@Loading", "Other", "B" };
Task.get("Loading")->next = { "Loading" };
Task.get_raw("B@Loading")->next = { "B#self", "B#next", "B#back" };
```

#### Some uses

- When several tasks have `"next": [ "#back" ]`, `"Task1@Task2@Task3"` represents the sequential execution of `Task3`, `Task2`, `Task1`。

#### Other related

```json
{
    "A": { "next": [ "N0" ] },
    "B": { "next": [ "A#next" ] },
    "C@A": { "next": [ "N1" ] }
}
```

In this case above, `"C@B" -> next` (i.e. `C@A#next`) is `["N1"]` instead of `["C@N0"]`.

## Runtime task modification

- `Task.lazy_parse()` loads the json task configuration file at runtime. The lazy_parse rules are the same as for [multi-file task](#multi-file task).
- `Task.set_task_base()` modifies the `baseTask` field of a task.

### Usage Example

Suppose you have the following task configuration file:

```json
{
    "A": {
        "baseTask": "A_default"
    },
    "A_default": {
        "next": [ "xxx" ]
    },
    "A_mode1": {
        "next": [ "yyy" ]
    },
    "A_mode2": {
        "next": [ "zzz" ]
    }
}
```

The following code enables changing task "A" based on the value of `mode`, and will also change other tasks that depend on task "A", e.g. "B@A":

```cpp
switch (mode) {
case 1:
    Task.set_task_base("A", "A_mode1");  // This is basically the same as replacing A with the contents of A_mode1, as follows
    break;
case 2:
    Task.set_task_base("A", "A_mode2");
    break;
default:
    Task.set_task_base("A", "A_default");
    break;
}
```

## Expression Calculation

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|:---------:|:---:|:--------:|
| `@` | Template task | `Fight@ReturnTo` |
| `#` (unary) | Virtual task | `#self` |
| `#` (binary) | Virtual task | `StartUpThemes#next` |
| `*` | Repeat tasks | `(ClickCornerAfterPRTS+ClickCorner)*5` |
| `+` | Task list merge | `A+B` |
| `^` | Task list difference (in the former but not in the latter, the order remains the same) | `(A+A+B+C)^(A+B+D)` (= `C`) |

The operators `@`, `#`, `*`, `+`, `^` have priority: `#` (unary) > `@` = `#` (binary) > `*` > `+` = `^`.

## Schema Check

This project configures a json schema check for `tasks.json`, the schema file is `docs/maa_tasks_schema.json`.

### Visual Studio

It is configured in `MaaCore.vcxporj` and works right out of the box. The hint effect is more obscure and some information is missing.

### Visual Studio Code

It is configured in `.vscode/settings.json`, open that **project folder** with vscode and you are ready to use it. The hint works better.
