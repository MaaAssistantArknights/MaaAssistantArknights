          I understand that Issues are for feedback and problem solving,
          not trolling the comments section, and will provide as
          much information as possible to help solve the problem.

      - label: >-
          I filled in a short, clear title
          so that developers could quickly identify the general problem
          when going through the issue list.
          Instead of "Some suggestions", "Stuck", etc.

          I have checked the latest beta update and there is no mention
          of the bug being fixed.

        If available, add screenshots to help explain your problem,
        including but not limited to screenshots of MAA software,
        screenshots of game screens.

        If the problem is **recognition related**, please help by providing
        the **original image** taken by the emulator's own screenshot tool
        (or via adb).

        Screenshots taken with other tools may contain the frames of the window/emulator, which makes it harder for us to debug.

        The `debug` folder has some automatic screenshots of the error images,
        if you have any,
        please upload them together.

        you are having.
