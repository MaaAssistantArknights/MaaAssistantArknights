          not trolling the comments section, and will provide as

          I filled in a short, clear title
          so that developers could quickly identify the general problem
          when going through the issue list.
          Instead of "Some suggestions", "Stuck", etc.

        **indicate the approximate point in time when the problem occurred.**

        **compress it before uploading if too large.**

        If available, add screenshots to help explain your problem,
        including but not limited to screenshots of MAA software,
        screenshots of game screens.

        If the problem is **recognition related**, please help by providing
        the **original image** taken by the emulator's own screenshot tool
        (or via adb).

        Screenshots taken with other tools may contain the frames of the window/emulator, which makes it harder for us to debug.

        The `debug` folder has some automatic screenshots of the error images,
        if you have any,
        please upload them together.

        Anything that will give us more insight into the problem
        you are having.
