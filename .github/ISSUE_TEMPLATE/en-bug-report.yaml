          I filled in a short, clear title
          so that developers could quickly identify the general problem
          when going through the issue list.
          Instead of "Some suggestions", "Stuck", etc.

        If available, add screenshots to help explain your problem,
        including but not limited to screenshots of MAA software,
        screenshots of game screens.

        If the problem is recognition related, please help by providing
        the original image taken by the emulator's own screenshot tool
        (or via adb).

        The `debug` folder has some automatic screenshots of the error images,
        if you have any,
        please upload them together.
