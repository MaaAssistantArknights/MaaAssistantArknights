        Please specify the operating system and version, emulator brand, emulator resolution, DPI, and frame rate.  
        If you are using MuMu or LDPlayer 9, please specify whether Screenshot Enhancement is enabled.

        If available, upload screenshots and recordings to help explain your problem,
        including but not limited to screenshots of MAA software,
        screenshots of game screens.  
        If the problem is **recognition related**, please help by providing
        the **original image** taken by the emulator's own screenshot tool
        (or via adb).  
        Screenshots taken with other tools may contain the frames of the window/emulator
        and their aspect ratio and resolution are inconsistent,
        which makes it harder for us to debug.  
        If the file size is too large, you may compress it before uploading.
